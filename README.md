# SmallSocialNetwork
A kind of tiny social network whose sole purpose is to explore and combine new technologies.

The code is created during a course of my Computer Science in Media studies at Furtwangen University. The aim is to highlight and get to know different technologies and combine them. The idea is to create a kind of small social network. The following technologies and languages will be used for the time being.

* Java
* Kotlin
* Ktor
* MongoDB
* Android
* Docker
* TypeScript
* HTML & CSS

The Android-App should be easy to run in Android Studio. The Microservice has itÂ´s own README with information on how to build and run it.
